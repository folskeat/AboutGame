# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to allow those people who enjoy playing video games to still make time for their hobby. As life gets busier, a lot of people give up on their past favorite hobbies. While it is good for hobbies to change as your life goals change, you shouldn't be forced into giving up something you love just because you can't find the time for it. The purpose of CompleteIt is to help people manage the time they spend playing video games so they can feel more accomplished as they play games, rather than like they are wasting their time and money.

In the future, this could even be used for more than video games, and act as an all purpose tool to help anybody manage their favorite hobbies, whether it's watching films, making crafts, reading books, or making websites!
