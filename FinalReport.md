## Summary

Complete-It helps users keep track of their time by giving them key checkpoints for games so they can know how long it will take them to complete it!

Read about the premise [here](https://github.com/folskeat/AboutGame/blob/main/README.md).

## What did you learn in this project?

We went over supabase and vercel very briefly in this class, so doing this project on my own gave me an opportunity to dive deep into what it can do. I learned how to insert into, get from, and update from supabase. I could do it very easily both from my local environment as well as my deployed environment. And deploying is very easy thanks to vercel. I also learned about how easy it is to put out something that anybody can see from anywhere.
I also learned how supabase can set up edge functions so we can run code without having it on the user end, which can be safer in a lot of situations. I learned how to connect an edge function to an API, where it could automatically generate access tokens that it could use. I also learned that you should research an API before you spend hours and hours trying to set it up only to realize that the API is very bad at what it does.
I also learned more about front end, and learning about what I should leave to javascript and what can be done by the style sheets alone. This is less related to the class, but through this class I was able to learn and grow in this aspect as well.
I learned how to connect the authentication table that is automatically built into supabase with my own user table, allowing logged in users to have differenent permissions as well as being able to save other things to their profile.

## Does your project integrate with AI in any interesting way?

No, it doesn't use AI at all. There isn't much I think it could use it for though. Maybe if I had gotten around to the calendar features then I could have saved myself some time programming that part by letting the AI come up with its own calendar based on the information I feed it.

## How did you use AI to assist in building your project?

I used it a lot, especially at first. Sometimes it would generate full blocks of code, or even entire files. But after using a lot with this project, I also learned how to use it better. I realized that sometimes when it would rewrite entire files, it would heavily mess up what you already have. Near the end I realized that the best way I could use AI was for small bits of code, asking how I would do something, then attempting to put things together myself for a bit. Sometimes I would code something and ask it what it does. It may seem weird to make code and have someone else explain it, but I think it helped me understand better. I also would use it to help make my code better strucutred. I would paste in some code and ask if there's any way I could refactor it to match good coding practices. 

## Discuss why this project is interesting to you!

I love playing video games but sometimes I don't finish a game because I don't manage my time for it very well, then I stop playing it and never get back around to it. The goal of complete it is to allow me to finish the games I start by helping me manage my free time better.

For key learnings, see the above "What did you learn in this project?"

As far as strategies and scaling go, supabase free should be able to handle everything on its own for a while, I don't see this product getting that big. And even when it does, I can go for the next tier, which isn't too expensive.

I suppose I would allow you to use my project as an example to future classes, but it isn't really in a complete state (ironic). So I don't think it would be of much use haha.
