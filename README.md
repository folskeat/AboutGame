### The pitch

Are you tired of having too many games and having completed none of them? Are you wanting to beat Yaga Dingo 1 before Yaga Dingo 2 comes out in February? Well do we have the product for you!

## Features

### Time to complete!
Looking for a new game to complete that doesn't take a million years? We let you know how long a game takes to complete, whether it's to the main credits, or for that sweet **100%**! Whether you are a pro speed runner or are just chilling while talking to friends, you can immediately get an idea of what kind of time investment a game will be before you fork over the money.

### Checkpoints!
**Checkpoints** are the name of the game for CompleteIt! Maybe you've had a game you've been working on, but the task seems so daunting that you just can't bring yourself to complete it. **Checkpoints** will make it easy to follow community set goals, or make your own! By logging your time at various checkpoints, your time will be compared to the average, so we can calculate how much time you will need to spend to reach future checkpoints as well as how long it will take you to cross that finish line!

### Goals!
**Goals** is a feature where you can give yourself a date by when you want to complete a game. After you have completed the first checkpoint and submitted the time it took you to get there, we can schedule out on a calendar what dates you will need to hit certain checkpoints so you can complete the game by the date you set. You can even submit a schedule of what days of the week and times of day you have available to play, and your goals will be set according to your schedule! Now you can make sure you finish your game before the sequel comes out so you can be experiencing all the new alongside everyone else!

## User Settings

### Calendar!
Setting a personal **calendar** allows you to better manage the time you spent gaming. It may sound weird to schedule a hobby, but you will find you will get more games complete (but I'm also not judging you if you want to spend another 1000 hours in Clash of Clans). By submitting your personal calendar, you can schedule out when to play what games so you can make your gaming sessions more productive!

### MySpeed!
When you first create an account, you will select your *speed* for **MySpeed**. There are three general options, being
 - I like to take my time
 - I follow a standard pace
 - Gotta go fast!!!

When scheduling your gaming sessions, the times it takes to hit various checkpoints will be based upon your speed setting. You will be given more time based on what you select. However, based on your first two or three checkpoints you've hit during a game, it will automatically update your times to reflect your speed for that game, as you might be very quick and playing one game but very slow at another. 
However, if you complete enough games, your speed setting may automatically be updated to reflect the speed at which you complete games.

### Friendships!
In CompleteIt, you can add your friends so you can see what games they are playing. You can follow along and congratulate them as they reach various goals in the games they are playing. You can also see what reviews your friends are leaving on their favorite games!

## Stretch Goals

Some future features that we would like to add, given enough time.

### Platform Support Integration!

Connect your *Steam* account, or other gaming accounts, to automatically log your times for you! Manually using a stopwatch isn't ideal. With Platform Integration, all you would need to do is click a button when you have completed a checkpoint. **CompleteIt** will automatically look at your Steam account to find the number of hours you were at when you click to calculate the time automatically. Just make sure you add the game to "Currently Playing" when you first start so we can analyze your number of hours when you first started.

### App Support and Notifications!

We have future plans to add support for an app, that will automatically connect to your account. That way you can keep track of everything in a more convenient manner. On top of that, you can set notifications reminding you when you need to play so you can keep up!

### Fun Extras!

Just extra little things that I think would be nice, like a way automatically rank games based on different criteria, such as your own ratings, your friend's ratings, or average ratings. It can also rank games based on difficulty, time to complete, and more!

## Other

### Technologies

I am planning on using SupaBase because that is what ChatGPT recommended for me to use, because it can do a lot while still staying in a free tier. This will use PostGres. I will use React for my front end and I am told that SupaBase can even host the front-end on the same website. 

### Money-Making Techniques

Probably have some ads on the website. I myself am not a big fan of ads that cover an entire web page, so I would keep ads to a minimum, maybe just one or two per page. But there would also be two tiers you can pay for, a $1 a month for no ads and small premium features, and a $5 tier with more premium features and just to support us.
